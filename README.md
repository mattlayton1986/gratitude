# Gratitude App
This is a small project I created in a single weekend. My work team announces who they're grateful for and why during weekly team meetings, and I created this tool to help my teammates keep track of their gratitude.

## Deployed Application
This application is live and functional at https://mattlayton1986.github.io/gratitude/.

Please note: this project is a work in progress. I spent a total of two weekends building the initial app (weekend 1 - MVP) and refactoring it and adding some feature requests from my colleagues (weekend 2).

As a work in progress, it is far from polished. In particular, the "Edit Item" functionality has not been implemented, so that button is currently disabled. 

## Tech Stack
- React
- MaterialUI
- Emotion
- Redux
- Redux-Persist
- Reselect
